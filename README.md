# level-5-full-stack-app

This is a full-stack fast food icecream shop website with React on the frontend and express/MongoDB/Mongoose on the backend. The app allows an individual to login/create an account, and then be able to browse items sorted by category. Logged in as a user, they will be able to add items to their cart and checkout with said items to create an order. The user's cart will be reset to empty and the order will be viewable, in addition to the user now being able to rate the ordered items. The user can also log out of their account and create another account or log in to another account.
